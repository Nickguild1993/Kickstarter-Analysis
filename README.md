# A thorough analysis of kickstarter campaigns 
The analysis of the kickstarter data set contains the findings from investigating a multitude of facets from a diverse group of campaigns.  Relationships between variables such as campaign type, length, fundraising goals and country of origin were examined for relationships and relavent findings to help Louise.

## Findings
*The following findings are based on a thorough analysis of successful, unsuccessful, live and canceled campaigns.
*We would recommend that Louise plan her kickstarter campaign to start up no later than March, and finish by June, as this is the time period that the most successful theatre campaigns took place, which is illiustrated in the chart below.

*While the fundraising goal for Louise's play, FEVER, isn't the close to the most ambtious of kickstarter theatre (plays) campaigns, it is well above the upper quartile of successful plays ($5,000) and is more in line with plays that failed to reach their goals (which had an upper quartile goal that is coincidentially the same amount ($10,000) that Louise is looking to raise.
